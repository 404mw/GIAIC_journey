// 10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, 
// and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
// just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
// Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
